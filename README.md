# Kubernetes Operational Handbook 🚧 Work in Progress
## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical experience with Kubernetes while deploying and troubleshooting containerized applications in a local Minikube environment.

The focus is on real-world operational workflows, debugging techniques, and reliability practices rather than just command memorization.

It includes scenarios such as:
- Debugging failing pods
- Resource limit and performance issues
- TLS and secret misconfiguration
- Service networking and communication
- Deployment rollouts and rollback strategies

I am building a strong foundation in Kubernetes, automation, and system reliability, with a long-term goal of growing into SRE and cloud infrastructure roles.
